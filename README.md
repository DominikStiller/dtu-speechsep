# Speech separation in the waveform domain
This is the repository for the [DTU 02456 Deep Learning](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456) project. The aim is to separate speakers in mixed speech signals using the [Demucs model](references/Defossez2019%20-%20Music%20Source%20Separation%20in%20the%20Waveform%20Domain.pdf), which was originally intended for stem separation of music. The project is supervised by Prof. Bj√∏rn Sand Jensen (Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science).
