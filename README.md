# Speech separation in the waveform domain
This is the repository for the [DTU 02456 Deep Learning](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456) project. The aim is to implement and apply deep neural networks to source separation for speech mixtures or polyphonic music in the waveform domain. The project is supervised by Prof. Bj√∏rn Sand Jensen (Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science).


## Setup
* Ensure Python 3.9 is installed
* Create a virtual environment with Python 3.9 interpreter
* Install requirements from `requirements.txt`
* Set the environment variable `LIBRIMIX_STORAGE_DIR` to the storage directory you used for `./generate_librimix.sh`


## Development
* Format code using `black .` in project directory before committing
