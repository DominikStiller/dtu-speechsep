# Speech separation in the waveform domain
This is the repository for the [DTU 02456 Deep Learning](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456) project. The aim is to implement and apply deep neural networks to source separation for speech mixtures or polyphonic music in the waveform domain. The project is supervised by Prof. Bj√∏rn Sand Jensen (Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science).
