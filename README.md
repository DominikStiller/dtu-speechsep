# Speech separation in the waveform domain
This is the repository for the [DTU 02456 Deep Learning](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456) project. The aim is to separate speakers in mixed speech signals using the [Demucs model](references/Defossez2019%20-%20Music%20Source%20Separation%20in%20the%20Waveform%20Domain.pdf), which was originally intended for stem separation of music. The project is supervised by Prof. Bj√∏rn Sand Jensen (Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science).

## Setup
* Ensure Python 3.9 is installed
* Create a virtual environment with Python 3.9 interpreter
* Install requirements from `requirements.txt`


## Development
* Format code using `black .` in project directory before committing
* Run all code in the project root directory so that paths relative to the current working directory work as intended
